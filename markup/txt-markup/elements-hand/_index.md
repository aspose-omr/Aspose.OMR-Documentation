Aspose.OMR does not confine respondents to merely filling in circles or checking boxes; it also allows handwritten text input or drawing pictures.

## Elements

- [**Write-in**](/omr/txt-markup/write_in/)  
  This element provides a blank field in which the respondent can hand write some text or draw a picture.
- [**Text input**](/omr/txt-markup/text_input/)  
  This element generates a placeholder consisting of several boxes in which the respondent can write letters or numbers, one character in each box.
