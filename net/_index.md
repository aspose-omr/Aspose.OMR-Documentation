**Welcome to the Aspose.OMR for .NET**

Aspose.OMR for .NET is an API to recognize optical marks from OMR digitized sheet images. It can be used to recognize optical marks in a variety of image formats like BMP, JPG, TIF, TIFF, GIF. The API allows capturing human-marked data from document forms such as surveys, questionnaires, multiple-choice examination papers, and other tests. With this solution, it is possible to recognize scanned images and even photos with high accuracy. Recognition is based on a template markup which contains a graphical mapping of the elements to be recognized from the scanned images. 

The Aspose.OMR for .NET also provides methods for creating custom answer sheets, test papers and many other types of omr forms. Utilize Template Generation functionality to design and save ready to print images for your respondents.
