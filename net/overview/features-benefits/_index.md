**Aspose.OMR for .NET** is a reliable and versatile programming API for creating custom on-premise or web-based OMR applications of any scale and complexity. It is extremely **easy to use** even for inexperienced developers. A simple application that can generate and recognize OMR forms can be written [in **10** lines of code](/omr/net/hello-world/).

## Key benefits

Aspose.OMR for .NET offers a wide range of benefits for projects of any size.

### Recognition

- **Superior recognition accuracy** that can be further fine-tuned for perfect results even in difficult conditions.
- **No equipment needed**. Use your existing office copier or even a smartphone camera instead of an expensive OMR scanner. You can even process rotated and skewed images.
- Respondents can fill out your forms with **pen, pencil, or marker** and use **any types of marks**.
- **Real-time recognition tuning** through a [visual UI control](/omr/net/working-with-ui-control/).
- **QR codes and barcodes recognition**.
- **Recognition of multi-page forms**.
- Recognition results are returned in **JSON, XML or CSV formats**, which allows you to import them into any relational or NoSQL database, spreadsheet, as well as into analytical and CRM systems.

### Designing OMR forms

- **Whole solution**. Aspose.OMR for .NET supports the complete OMR workflow - from [designing](/omr/net/design-form/) a form to [recognizing](/omr/net/recognition/) its filled hardcopies.  
  No external editors and design tools are required.
- **Very flexible markup language** for designing OMR forms of any layout and complexity.
- **QR codes, barcodes and images** can be added to OMR forms.
- **Support for all popular paper sizes** as well as a number of non-standard ones.

## Limitations

- Optical character recognition (OCR) in OMR forms is not supported at the moment. You can combine Aspose.OMR for .NET with [Aspose.OCR](https://products.aspose.app/ocr) to deal with such cases.
