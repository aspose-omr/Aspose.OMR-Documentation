{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

In the text markup, all element attribute names are preceded by <**\t**> symbol (tabulation)

{{% /alert %}} 

The following is the text markup that is used in the example code snippet to generate the OMR template file.

## **Save output image as PDF**
By using Aspose.OMR for .NET, you may save the output images generated during the template generation as PDF. To achieve this, the API provides the GenerationResult.SaveAsPdf method. The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the GenerationResult.SaveAsPdf method to save the output image as PDF.
