OMR is a fast and fail-safe way to process surveys, ballots, checklists, insurance claim forms, and similar questionnaires in which the respondent answers questions by filling in circles or checking boxes.

With Aspose.OMR elements, you can programmatically design professional-looking questionnaires that can be automatically recognized.
