Aspose.OMR does not confine respondents to merely filling in circles or checking boxes; it also allows handwritten text input or drawing pictures.

## Elements

- [**Write-in**](/omr/net/programmatic-forms/writeinconfig/)  
  This element provides a blank field in which the respondent can hand write some text or draw a picture.
- [**Text input**](/omr/net/programmatic-forms/textinputconfig/)  
  This element generates a placeholder consisting of several boxes in which the respondent can write letters or numbers, one character in each box.
- [**Free text input**](/omr/net/programmatic-forms/freetextinputconfig/)  
  This element generates a placeholder where the respondent can enter handwritten text in a free-form manner.
