OMR is a fast and easy way to process customer satisfaction surveys, voting ballots, customs forms, and similar questionnaires in which the respondent answers questions by filling in circles or checking boxes.

With Aspose.OMR text markup, you can design professional-looking questionnaires that can be automatically recognized.

## Elements

- [Question](/omr/net/txt-markup/question/)

- [checkbox](/omr/net/txt-markup/checkbox/)
