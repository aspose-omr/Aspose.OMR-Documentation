  Lightweight text markup language specifically tailored for Aspose.OMR forms.
- [JSON markup](/omr/net/json-markup/)  
  Describe Aspose.OMR forms as nested data structures using the most popular data exchange format.
- [Building forms programmatically](/omr/net/programmatic-layout/)  
  Describe an OMR form directly in the application code.
