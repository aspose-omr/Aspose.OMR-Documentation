Aspose.OMR offers you several ways to design OMR forms of any layout and complexity. They all work equally well and produce the same results - just choose the approach that you are most comfortable with.

- [Draw the form interactively](https://products.aspose.app/omr/omr-sheet-designer)  
  Design machine-readable forms with our free online editor. Simply place the elements on the sheet using your mouse, drag, and resize them to best suit your requirements. With our tool, you can quickly create answer sheets, surveys, questionnaires, and other machine-readable forms without the need to learn template or write a single line of code. Moreover, you can take it a step further and design Aspose.OMR forms directly from your approved templates and printouts, using the original image as a background.  
  Once done, you get the printable OMR sheet and a special recognition pattern file that is required for Aspose.OMR API to recognize the hand-filled marks. The OMR sheet image can be printed on a regular office printer and filled with a pen, pencil or marker. Use your existing office copier or even a smartphone camera to capture an image of the completed form and recognize it with Aspose.OMR library. Recognition results are nearly 100% accurate, eliminating the long, tedious and error-prone manual processing.
