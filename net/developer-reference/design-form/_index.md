Aspose.OMR offers you several ways to design OMR forms of any layout and complexity. They all work equally well and produce the same results - just choose the approach that you are most comfortable with.

- [Text markup](/omr/txt-markup/)  
  Lightweight text markup language specifically tailored for Aspose.OMR forms.
- [JSON markup](/omr/json-markup/)  
  Describe Aspose.OMR forms as nested data structures using the most popular data exchange format.
- [Building forms programmatically](/omr/net/programmatic-forms/)  
  Describe the layout and content of Aspose.OMR for .NET form directly in the application code.
