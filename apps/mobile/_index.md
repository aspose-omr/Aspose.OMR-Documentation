**Aspose.OMR** is an essential app for any teacher that turns your Android smartphone, iPhone or iPad into an optical reader / scoring machine for creating and grading multiple choice paper tests (answer sheets). Forget tedious and error-prone manual scoring or waiting for a Scantron device - simply take a photo of a completed answer sheet in class and instantly get a result that can be imported into a student database.

The app is suitable for any test or assessment - from a quick quiz to a final exam. The design and layout of answer sheets created by the app is fully customizable. The app automatically aligns all responses to fit the page perfectly and creates a printable form without design tools and writing a line of code. The machine-readable form is fully compatible with Aspose Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) technology and can be reused in [desktop](https://docs.aspose.com/omr/net/) or [web](https://products.aspose.app/omr/family/) applications.
