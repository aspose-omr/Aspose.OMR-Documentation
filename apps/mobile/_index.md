With Aspose.OMR, creation and automatic recognition of answer sheets, surveys, questionnaires, insurance claims, customs declarations, voting ballots and similar hand-filled forms no longer require expensive equipment and accessories. Advanced image analysis and artificial intelligence techniques made it possible to use a regular pen and paper, a common office printer, and a smartphone camera instead of dedicated scanners and special paper, without affecting recognition accuracy and confidence in the result.

Install our free mobile app to create, photograph and recognize OMR forms with your Android smartphone, iPhone or tablet.
