The app can create answer sheets for any test or assessment - from a quick quiz to a final exam. You can customize the following parameters:

- **Paper size**:

<table style="margin-left:40px;">
	<tr>
		<th>Size</th>
		<th>Dimensions, inch</th>
		<th>Dimensions, mm</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Letter</b></td>
		<td>8.5 x 11</td>
		<td>215.9 x 279.4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>A4</b></td>
		<td>8.3 Ã— 11.7</td>
		<td>210 x 297</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Legal</b></td>
		<td>8.5 x 14</td>
		<td>216 x 356</td>
	</tr>
</table>


- **Questions** - the total number of questions on a sheet. The maximum value depends on the paper size.
- **Bubbles** - the number of bubbles per question:

<table style="margin-left:40px;">
	<tr>
		<th>Bubbles</th>
		<th>Result</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>3</b></td>
		<td><img src="bubble3.png" alt="3 bubbles" /></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>4</b></td>
		<td><img src="bubble4.png" alt="4 bubbles" /></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>5</b></td>
		<td><img src="bubble5.png" alt="5 bubbles" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>

- **Answer keys** - characters to be drawn inside bubbles:

<table style="margin-left:40px;">
	<tr>
		<th>Keys</th>
		<th>Result</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>A..Z</b></td>
		<td><img src="caps.png" alt="Capital letters" /></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>a..z</b></td>
		<td><img src="small.png" alt="Small letters" /></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>1..9</b></td>
		<td><img src="numbers.png" alt="Numbers" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>
