**Aspose.OMR for Java** is a robust and versatile programming API for building on-premise, web-based or cloud applications for creating and recognizing machine-readable forms. It is extremely **easy to use** even for inexperienced developers. A basic application that generates and recognizes OMR forms can be written in less than [**10** lines of code](/omr/java/hello-world/).

## Key benefits

Aspose.OMR for Java offers a wide range of benefits for projects of any size. Aspose.OMR for Java supports the complete OMR workflow - from designing a form to recognizing its filled hardcopies.  

### Recognition

- **Industry-grade recognition accuracy** that can be further fine-tuned for achieving perfect results even under challenging conditions. It can easily handle dust, dirt, invalid marks, skewed images, and other anomalies.
- **No equipment needed**. Use your existing office copier or even a smartphone camera instead of an expensive OMR scanner.
- Respondents can complete your forms with **pen, pencil or marker**. You can fine-tune recognition thresholds to use **any type of marks** - from solid fill to pencil checkmark.
- Recognition results are returned in **CSV or JSON** formats, which allows you to import them into any relational or NoSQL database, spreadsheet, as well as into analytical and CRM systems.

### Designing OMR forms

- **Create machine-readable forms** without specialized graphic editors and advanced layout tools.
- **Very flexible markup language** for designing OMR forms of any layout and complexity with a few lines of code.
- **Customize** OMR forms by adding images and texts.
- **Support for all popular paper sizes** as well as a number of non-standard ones.

## Limitations

- Optical character recognition (OCR) in machine-readable forms is not supported at the moment. You can combine Aspose.OMR for Java with [Aspose.OCR](https://products.aspose.app/ocr) to deal with such cases.
