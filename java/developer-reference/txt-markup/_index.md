Aspose.OMR for Java offers a lightweight markup language specifically tailored for describing content and layout of machine-readable forms. It allows you to easily create answer sheets, surveys and other questionnaires without graphic editors or advanced layout tools. The markup language is content-focused, with minimal number of tags or formatting instructions.

Form sources are stored as plain-text files that can be modified with any general-purpose text editor or code editor (such as **Notepad** or **Visual Studio Code**). The following encodings are supported:

- **UTF-8**, with or without BOM (byte order mark). Recommended encoding that can accommodate forms in any combination of natural languages, including Extended Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, and more.
- **ANSI** - for forms that use Western European characters only.

You can use Windows (_CRLF_), Unix (_LF_) and Mac OS 9 (_CR_) line endings.
