## Design

Describe the content and layout of the form using the specialized [**text markup language**](/omr/java/txt-markup/).

## Generate

[**Generate**](/omr/java/generate-template/) a **printable form** for the chosen **paper size** and a **recognition pattern** file that is used to map optical marks to bubbles for highly accurate recognition.

## Recognize

[**Recognize**](/omr/java/recognition/) scans or photos of completed forms and **get results** in most popular data exchange formats.
