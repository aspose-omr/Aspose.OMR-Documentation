## Welcome to Aspose.OMR for Java

![Aspose.OMR for Java](omr-java.png)

**Aspose.OMR for Java** eliminates the need for manual validation and data entry from uniform machine-readable forms: exam answer sheets, quizzes, surveys, ballots, questionnaires, and more. Its easy-to-use, flexible API allows you to add Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) functionality to [any device](/omr/java/system-requirements/) that can run a Java Virtual Machine.

The library covers the full cycle of processing OMR forms: from designing the printable template to recognizing hand-filled forms. It is extremely cost-effective: you don't need to purchase and learn design tools, buy expensive scanners or specialized consumables. To create and process questionnaires of any type, an ordinary office copier and an entry-level smartphone are more than enough.

Aspose's expertise in machine learning and AI libraries, years of customer feedback, and cutting-edge technology ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliable results at any scale, from elections to classroom quizzes.
