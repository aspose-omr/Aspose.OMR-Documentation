## Welcome to Aspose.OMR for C++

![Aspose.OMR for C++](omr-cpp.png)

**Aspose.OMR for C++** is a fast, reliable, and cost-effective API for working with machine-readable forms from C++ applications. With it, you no longer need to manually check and grade tests, exam papers, surveys, applications, and other hand-filled uniform documents. Our library will do everything for you and return results that can be automatically analyzed or imported into a database, gradebook or CRM system of your choice.

The library is built with economic efficiency in mind. No need to purchase and learn professional design and layout software - machine-readable forms of any complexity can be created with a few lines of code in an easy-to-read and flexible markup language. No need to buy expensive scanners or specialized consumables - an ordinary office copier and an entry-level smartphone are more than enough. Respondents can fill in your forms with any pen, pencil or marker.

Aspose's expertise in machine learning and AI libraries, years of customer feedback, and cutting-edge technology ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliable results at any scale, from elections to classroom quizzes. Aspose.OMR for C++ is extremely easy to use - even the most complex mathematical operations and algorithms are combined into several methods that even an inexperienced developer can read and support.

As a result, building a software optical mark reader (OMR) with Aspose.OMR for C++ becomes a trivial task.
