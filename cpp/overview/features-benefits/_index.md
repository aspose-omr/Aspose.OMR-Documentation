**Aspose.OMR for C++** is a robust and versatile programming API for building C++ applications for creating and recognizing machine-readable forms. It is extremely **easy to use** even for inexperienced developers. A basic application that generates and recognizes OMR forms can be written in less than [**10** lines of code](/omr/cpp/hello-world/).

## Key benefits

Aspose.OMR for C++ offers a wide range of benefits for projects of any size. Aspose.OMR for C++ supports the complete OMR workflow - from designing a printable form to recognizing hand-filled hardcopies.

### Recognition

- **Highest recognition accuracy** that can be further fine-tuned for achieving results you can trust. The recognition accuracy remain the same even under challenging conditions: dust, dirt, invalid marks, skewed images, and the like.
- **Minimal hardware requirements**. Use your existing office copier or even a smartphone camera instead of an expensive optical mark reader.
- Respondents can complete your forms with **pen, pencil or marker**. You can fine-tune recognition thresholds to use **any type of marks** - from solid fill to slight pencil mark.
- Recognition results are returned in **CSV or JSON** formats, which allows you to import them into any relational or NoSQL database, spreadsheet, as well as into analytical and CRM systems.

### Designing OMR forms

- **Create OMR forms** without specialized graphic editors and advanced layout tools.
- **Highly versatile markup languages** for designing OMR forms of any layout and complexity with a few lines of code.
- **Customization and personalization** of OMR forms with images and texts.
- **Support for all popular paper sizes** as well as a number of non-standard ones.

## Limitations

Aspose.OMR for C++ does not support optical character recognition (OCR) of write-in fields in machine-readable forms. You can combine Aspose.OMR for C++ with [Aspose.OCR](https://products.aspose.app/ocr) to extend the functionality.
